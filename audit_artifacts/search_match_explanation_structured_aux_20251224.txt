Example output for query "sunset beach":
{
  "type": "metadata",
  "overallConfidence": 0.6,
  "reasons": [
    {
      "category": "Notes / Tags / Locations",
      "matched": "Matched via notes, tags, locations, or people tags for 'sunset beach'",
      "confidence": 0.6,
      "badge": "🔖",
      "type": "metadata"
    }
  ],
  "breakdown": {
    "metadata_score": 60,
    "filename_score": 0,
    "content_score": 0,
    "semantic_score": 0
  }
}

Notes:
- This replaces the previous plain-string explanation for auxiliary hits in `/search` responses.
- UI components (MatchExplanation) can now render auxiliary matches consistently without special casing.
