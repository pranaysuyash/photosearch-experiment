# Task 10.2: Vector Storage (Experiment)

## Goal
Create a lightweight, local system to store the high-dimensional vectors generated by the Embedding Engine and perform similarity searches.

## Components

### `server/vector_store.py`
A simple, in-memory vector database powered by `numpy`.

*   **Storage**:
    *   `ids`: List of file identifiers.
    *   `embeddings`: Numpy matrix (N x 512).
    *   `metadata`: List of dicts (for storing file paths, etc.).
*   **Search Algorithm**:
    *   **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the angle between two vectors. Values range from -1 to 1 (1 being identical).
    *   *Implementation*: Dot product of normalized vectors.
*   **Persistence**:
    *   Uses `pickle` to save the index to disk.
    *   *Note*: This is sufficient for <100k items. For larger datasets, we would switch to FAISS or ChromaDB.

## Verification
Run `test_vector_store.py` to verify:
1.  Adding vectors.
2.  Searching finds the mathematically closest vector.
3.  Save/Load persistence works.
