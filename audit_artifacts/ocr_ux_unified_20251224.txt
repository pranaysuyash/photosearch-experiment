OCR UX Unification — 2025-12-24

Change:
- Route /studio/ocr-search now redirects to /analytics/ocr (advanced OCRTextSearchPanel).
- Removed the legacy OCRSearch lazy import to avoid duplicate OCR experiences.

Reason:
- Audit noted fragmented OCR UX across studio and analytics surfaces. Redirect consolidates entry to the advanced OCR panel with highlighting, batch, and regions.

Files:
- ui/src/router/MainRouter.tsx
