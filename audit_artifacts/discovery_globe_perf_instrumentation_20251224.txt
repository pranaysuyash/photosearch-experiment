Discovery/Globe performance instrumentation — 2025-12-24

Change:
- Added dev-only performance logging to PhotoGlobe region overlays (index build, region count computation, alpha texture generation) to surface timing and region counts during development.
- Flagged by import.meta.env.DEV; no production logging.

How to use:
- Open Globe view in dev; console shows [PhotoGlobe] entries with durations (ms), feature/bucket counts, regions with photos, total located photos.
- Use these logs to spot expensive operations (geojson load, region indexing, overlay texture creation) and guide further optimizations (e.g., reduce resolution, throttle updates, or precompute indices).

Files touched:
- ui/src/components/features/PhotoGlobe.tsx
